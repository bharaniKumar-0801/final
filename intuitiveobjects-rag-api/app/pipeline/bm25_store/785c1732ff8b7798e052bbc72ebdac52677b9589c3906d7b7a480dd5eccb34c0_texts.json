However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-\nrelated foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8", "The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\ncounterparties to the Company's derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nApril 1,\n2023\nSeptember 24,\n2022\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\n$\n14,651 \n$\n13,378 \nCurrent and non-current term debt\n$\n(18,249)\n$\n(18,739)\n(1)\n(2)\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9", "Accounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\"Form 10-Q\") contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\nthe potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \"future,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\"\n\"can,\" \"may,\" and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the \"2022 Form 10-K\") under the heading \"Risk Factors.\"\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\nperiods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\n\"Company\" and \"Apple\" as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance\nmatters, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years\n2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company's total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during\nthe second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.
