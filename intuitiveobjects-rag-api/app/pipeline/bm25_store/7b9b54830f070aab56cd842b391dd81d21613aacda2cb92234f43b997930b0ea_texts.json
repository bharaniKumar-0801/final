However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-\nrelated foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 8", "The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\ncounterparties to the Company's derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's hedged items in fair value hedges as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nJuly 1,\n2023\nSeptember 24,\n2022\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\n$\n14,863 \n$\n13,378 \nCurrent and non-current term debt\n$\n(17,986)\n$\n(18,739)\n(1)\n(2)\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 9", "Accounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer.

The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.
