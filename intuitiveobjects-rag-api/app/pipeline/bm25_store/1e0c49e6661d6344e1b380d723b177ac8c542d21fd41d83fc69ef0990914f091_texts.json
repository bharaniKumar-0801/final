However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

(\"Epic\") filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \"Northern California District Court\") against the\nCompany alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic's claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company's claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these \"Terms\") apply to a particular restricted stock unit\naward (the \"Award\") granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the \"Company\"), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant\n(the \"Grant Notice\") corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\n\"Participant.\" The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \"Award Date.\" The Award was granted\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \"Plan\"). Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the \"Award Agreement\" applicable to the Award.\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term \"RSU\" shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall not\nbe treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \"Vesting Date.\") Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement\nDate and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal\nleave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant's consent thereto.\n1", "5.    Dividend and Voting Rights.\n(a)    Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nstock as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n(b)        Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its\nShares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its\nShares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to\nthe Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a \"Dividend Equivalent Right\"). Any Dividend Equivalent\nRights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms,\nconditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however,\nthat the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made\npursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid\npursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.\n6.    Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.    Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following each Vesting Date determined\npursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 or following the Participant's death as specified in Section 8(d) (and in all events not later than two and one-\nhalf (2  1/2) months after such Vesting Date or the date of the Participant's death, as applicable), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a\nnumber of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as determined by\nthe Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant's Retirement, death\nor Disability, are treated as vesting) on the applicable Vesting Date or the Participant's death, as applicable, less Tax-Related Items, unless such\nRSUs terminate prior to the given Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company's obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment\nwith respect to vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any\nShares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to\nSection 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to\nSection 8.\n8.    Effect of Termination of Service.\n(a)        Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant's RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\nEquivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant's Termination of Service, meaning\nthe first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the \"Severance Date\"),\nregardless of the reason for the Participant's Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the\nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.\n2", "(b)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant's\nTermination of Service due to the Participant's Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, any unvested\nRSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d))\nwithout regard to the Participant's Termination of Service, determined by multiplying (i) the number of RSUs eligible to vest on the applicable\nVesting Date, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Award Date and the\nParticipant's Retirement date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days contained in the period between the Award Date\nand the applicable Vesting Date. For purposes of this Award Agreement, \"Retirement\" means the Participant's Termination of Service on or after\nthe Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary\n(including service with any entity acquired by the Company) as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In\nthe event the Participant's Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless\nthe Committee shall otherwise determine. For purposes of this Section 8(b), a Termination of Service shall not include the Participant's\nTermination of Service resulting from the Participant's Disability or death (in which case Section 8(c) or 8(d), as applicable, will apply).\n(c)    In the event of the Participant's Termination of Service due to the Participant's Disability, any unvested RSUs shall continue\nto be eligible to vest in full (in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)) without regard to the Participant's\nTermination of Service.\n(d)    In the event of the Participant's Termination of Service due to the Participant's death, all unvested RSUs eligible to vest on\nVesting Date(s) subsequent to the Participant's death shall accelerate and vest immediately, and upon the Participant's death following the\nParticipant's Termination of Service due to Disability or Retirement any RSUs that were eligible to vest in full, or pro rata in the case of\nRetirement, will be settled as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant's death in accordance with Section 7.\n(e)    If any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall\nautomatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by the Company and\nwithout any other action by the Participant or the Participant's personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.    Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, \"clawback\" or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company\nmay require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n(a)    during the period of the Participant's employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the \"Employment\nPeriod\"), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense\nunder the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n3", "(b)        during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of\nconfidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of\nthe Company or any of its Subsidiaries;\n(c)    during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,\nembezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant's\nbehalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding the Participant's Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-\nconvey, transfer, or otherwise return such Shares and other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company's exclusive remedy\nwith respect to such matters.\n10.    Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's stock contemplated by\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of\nthe Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited\npursuant to Section 5(b).\n11.    Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer\n(\"Employer\") take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant's\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\nthe Company and the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with\nany aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares\nacquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to\nstructure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any\nparticular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the\nCompany or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one\njurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the\nCompany or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company or the Employer, or their\nrespective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable\nwithholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n(a)    withholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term cash incentives, payable to the Participant\nby the Company or the Employer;\n(b)    withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid\nupon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n(c)    arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant's behalf and at the Participant's\ndirection pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n4", "(d)    withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or\n(e)    any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by\nApplicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then\nthe  Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,\nby withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method\n(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of\nmethods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,\nincluding maximum rates applicable in the Participant's jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded\nto the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek\na refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number\nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested\nRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may\nrefuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the\nParticipant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.    Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by\nelectronic means or request the Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means.

The Company and its related entities may transfer Data amongst\nthemselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration, and management of the Participant's participation in the Plan, and\nthe Company and its related entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the\nimplementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data\nmay be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or\nother form, for the purposes of implementing, administering, and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any transfer of\nsuch Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant's behalf to a broker or\nto other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or\notherwise).\n5", "14.

Plan. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the\nprovisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.\nThe Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise\nexpressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the\nCommittee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are\notherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan\nafter the date hereof.\n16.        Entire Agreement. This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior\nunderstandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award\nAgreement may be amended pursuant to Section  15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The\nCompany may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the\nParticipant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any\nother provision hereof.\n17.    Limitation on the Participant's Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided.

The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the \"Award Agreement\" applicable to the\nAward.\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term \"RSU\" shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\nfor the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs\nshall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and\nExhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \"Vesting Date\").\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

In the event the Participant's Termination of\nService occurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall\notherwise determine.\n(c)    If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\nEquivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain\noutstanding following the Severance Date by reason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied,\nsuch RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration\nby the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.
