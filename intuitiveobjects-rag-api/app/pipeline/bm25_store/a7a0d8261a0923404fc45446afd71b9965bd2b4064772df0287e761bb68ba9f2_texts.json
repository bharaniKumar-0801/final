However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company's hedged term debt- and marketable securities-related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized\nwithin 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nJune 25,\n2022\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n76,234 \n$\n76,475 \nInterest rate contracts\n$\n20,775 \n$\n16,875 \nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n84,506 \n$\n126,918 \nThe gross fair values of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to net\nincome for the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022\nand June 26, 2021.\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 9", "The carrying amounts of the Company's hedged items in fair value hedges as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nJune 25,\n2022\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\n$\n14,250 \n$\n15,954 \nCurrent and non-current term debt\n$\n(19,281)\n$\n(17,857)\nThe gains and losses on the Company's derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in\nthe three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nThe Company's cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June  25, 2022, the\nCompany had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 12%.

Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\ndollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air  and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro , both powered by the new\nApple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS  Ventura, iPadOS  16 and watchOS  9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\navailable in the fall of 2022.\nThe Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022.\n(r)\n(r)\n(r)\n(r)\n(r)\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 14", "COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders.
